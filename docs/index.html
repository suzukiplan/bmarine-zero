    <p><a>SHOOT 'EM UP! Battle Marine is a simple naval barrage STG. A barrage of intense shots! Shoot 'em up! Shoot 'em
            up! Chain bombs with detonation, powerful laser sweeps, and jumps to collect medals! Enjoy a RETRO but NEW
            and exhilarating STG experience!</a></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Battle Marine is a simple naval barrage STG.<br>
        Enjoy a somewhat retro yet new and exhilarating game experience by firing a barrage of shots, inducing
        explosions, sweeping with powerful lasers, and automatically collecting medals (recovery and score) by
        jumping.<br>
        Destroying enemies consecutively within a certain time frame will result in a HIT combo. Aim for 999 HITs!<br>
        Your rank will be assessed according to the results of your play. Aim for the rank of FLEET ADMIRAL!
    </p>

    <h2>Controls</h2>

    <p>
        This game can be played with a USB-connected gamepad (both XInput and DirectInput compatible) or keyboard.<br>
        <img src="joypad.png"><br>
        Use the cursor keys to move left and right, press B to shoot, and A to jump.<br>

        laser.<br>
        Press A briefly for small jumps and long for large jumps.<br>
        Button assignments can be freely customized in the Key Config menu.<br>
        <br>

    <h2>Detailed Gameplay</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>When you destroy an enemy, a green or red medal will appear.</li>
        <li>Taking the green medal will restore your LIFE.</li>
        <li>Your score will increase if you take a red medal.</li>
        <li>If you keep defeating enemies within a certain time (120 frames), your combo will increase and medals will
            be collected automatically when you reach 100 HITs or more.</li>
        <li>Medals are also automatically collected by jumping.</li>
        <li>You are invincible during the laser (after the firing motion is complete).</li>
        <li>Unlike normal STGs, explosions also have hit points.</li>
        <li>If you keep collecting green medals while your LIFE is full, the red medal's base points will continue to
            increase.</li>
        <li>The number of crowns at the bottom of the screen will increase for every 16 green medals you take while your
            LIFE is full.</li>
        <li>The maximum number of crowns displayed is 30 (480 green medals), but the maximum number of crowns is 4,095
            (65,535 green medals).</li>
        <li>When you collide with enemy bullets, your LIFE will be reduced and the number of crowns will be strongly
            reduced.</li>
        <li>With the exception of some enemies (crabs), red medals will appear when enemies are killed by lasers.</li>
        <li>Obtaining a medal also resets the combo duration to 120 frames</li>
    </ul>
